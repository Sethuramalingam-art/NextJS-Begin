# NextJS-Begin

Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations.

Under the hood, Next.js also abstracts and automatically configures tooling needed for React, like bundling, compiling, and more. This allows you to focus on building your application instead of spending time with configuration.

Whether you're an individual developer or part of a larger team, Next.js can help you build interactive, dynamic, and fast React applications.

React is Client Side rendering
Next.js, three types of rendering methods are available: Server-Side Rendering, Static Site Generation, and Client-Side Rendering.

NextJS adv's

Rendering
In SSR, user from client request to server for html and js, it will prerendered in server and sent to client. 
So SEO will be fast and accurate because content all are loaded already.
-> Easy crawling
-> indexing
leading to improved SEO

Routing
Next Js uses file based routing system. No need of third party lib called react router

app -> about means localhost:3000/about -> no need of configurations needed


fullstack 
using next js we can develop full stack app
using API routes

API routes -> enabling the creation of serverless functions to handle API req's

Serverless API's in nextjs are a way of creating API endpoints. without the need for a traditional server

it allows us to build and deploy API's
-> without managing server infrastructure
-> worrying about scaling their server as traffic increases

with this feature we can create API endpoints 
inside specific folder -> route.js -> corresponds to that route API endpoint 

automatic code splitting 
-> linting
-> formatting
-> compiling
-> bundling
-> minifying
-> deploying


it is fundamentally top of react - that is next js it is not a new framwork
