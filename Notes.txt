Next JS

Only the root layout can contain <html> and <body> tags.

It will support both Client side and server side rendering

When component defined into the nextJs when we mentioned 
'use client' at the top the component it is client side rendering so we can use => react and react hooks
When plain component is there without any use client that is server side rendering we can't use react and react hooks

So when to use server side and client side components? 

Server side component             client side component
fetch data from backend           add interactivity and event listeners (onclick, onchange etc)
access backend resources          use state and lifecycle methods (usestate, usereducer, useeffect)
keep sensitvie info on the        use custom hooks that depend on state effects 
server(access tokens, api keys)   use react class components 
keep large denpendencies on the server
/ reduce client-side js
